Numberjack is a modelling package written in Python for constraint programming
and combinatorial optimization. Python benefits from a large and active
programming community, Numberjack is therefore a perfect tool to embed CP
technology into larger applications. It is designed to support a number of
underlying C/C++ solvers seamlessly and efficiently.

* Numberjack offers a high level modelling platform.
* Numberjack directly benefits from Python's features and modules.
* Numberjack uses efficient underlying C/C++ solvers.
